## A Recommender Tutorial ##

If you're here, it's probably because you are taking the [District Data Labs](http://districtdatalabs.com) _Building Data Apps with Python_ course. If you're sitting in class, waiting for it to start- go ahead and clone the master branch of this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/science-bookclub.git

Note that you might have to fork the repository into your own username if authentication over SSL is not working correctly. If you're really ahead of the game- go ahead and set up your virtual environment and install the various dependencies. 

If you're here after the class- congratulations on making it through! I know the course was probably a whirlwind of full immersion, and you don't know where to begin. This repository is broken up into branches. The `master` branch - or the branch that you're currently in, simply has the python project stubs- but no code has been added as of right now. It is my recommendation that you clone this branch and attempt to fill in the code for yourself. 

If you're in trouble and need help- then go ahead and checkout the code from other branches to see the code that we wrote in class (or something close to it). Remember, this is a learning exercise, so try to be creative and come up with your own solutions!

### What is an Octavo? ###

The definition of "octavo" is as follows:

    oc·ta·vo
    äkˈtävō/Submit
    noun
    noun: octavo; symbol: 8vo

    1. a size of book page that results from the folding of each printed
       sheet into eight leaves (sixteen pages).

       - a book of octavo size.

    plural noun: octavos

Since we're doing a project with books, this is a farily short namespace and no one else is using this name, I thought it would be a great name for our package and command line program!

The picture refers to the cover of a fictional book by Karen Engelmann: [The Stockholm Octavo](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061995347/), a literary historical fiction set in Sweeden, where the main characters perform [cartomancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartomancy) to divine the future. We don't have to perform cartomancy, we have a predictive model in the form our recommender system!
